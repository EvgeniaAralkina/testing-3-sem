                Function start
        :param inpt: a string of 4 characters separated by a space
                    the first character is the choice of action:
                         1 - count the number of permutations
                         2 - count the number of combinations
                         3 - count the number of placements
                         4 - calculate the probability of an event
                         5 - calculate the probability using the Bernouli formula
                         6 - calculate the probability by Poisson's formula
                    second character - n
                    the third character is m, if there is no such character then "."
                    the fourth character is n, if there is no such character then "."
        :return: result, int, if the input is incorrect then -1
